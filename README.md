This is a simple mod written in ~~Kotlin~~ Scala that adds four kinds of random ores that generate in the three vanilla dimensions naturally and rarely. As their names, they drop vanilla ores after being mined. It also provides a config to adjust ore generation features like vein size, oregen height and more.
